Welcome to the ESE3H Team N repository for the team projects, TP3 and PSD3, in the School of Computing Science (formerly known as DCS).

On using git
* Sign up for a github account and let Kristian know the account name for access
* Use ssh-keygen (default location) to generate a key, and add it (copy from file ~/.ssh/rsa_id.pub) in your github account settings for easy access
* clone the repository by using git clone git@github.com:kristianhentschel/ESE3H-Team-Project-Group-N.git in a directory of your choice. this will create another directory called ESE3H-Team-Project.....
* if you made changes, add the files by using git add filename. commit even small changes using git commit -m "note saying what you changed".
* to send it to the online repository, use git push origin master. to get latest changes from online, use git pull origin master
* to revert your changes and get the ones from online instead, use git checkout filename.
* if you need to delete or move around things you had committed, use git rm, git mv, etc.
