Things that should be mentioned in here:

Integrate with strain gauges, update conversion method, test accuracy and calibration with known weights.

Scale units should be ported to M0 based system which will lead to smaller PCB. Need to be placed in IP-65 boxes to meet client's requirements.

Power usage at 250mA for scale units is too high. Minimise power usage through power supply redesign. Also, the ZigBee devices on scale units should be configured as end-devices, and transport layer logic should support pin sleep mode to turn the radio off when it is not required.

Test for robustness by modifying units to send invalid packets, or provide artificially generated RF interference.

Incorporate visual feedback in user interface if a unit does not respond to a measurement request.

Run a user test with mechanical engineers who will be using the system, and confirm that it is simple enough for them to set-up and take down for redeployment in different locations. Provide a user manual.

Integrate the Raspberry Pi master unit with a USB wifi dongle, configure hostapd and dnsmasq to create a hot-spot without hte need for an external router.

Analogue Design tested by replacing strain gauge with potentiometer of same resistance range, but it still does not work with the calculated gain resistance for the differential amplifier.
