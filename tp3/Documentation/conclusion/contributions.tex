A further team member, Gary Allan, had to leave the team in November due to deferring his third year at university. He contributed to the requirements gathering and initial system design in conjunction with all other Team members. Originally, it was anticipated that he would assist with the software development for the embedded microcontroller. This work was taken up mostly by Kristian after his leaving.
