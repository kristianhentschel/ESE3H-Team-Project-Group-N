The system requirements as defined by the UGR team's liason were split into functional and non-functional requirements.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system must be wireless.
\item Each wheel must be weighed simultaniously.
\item Basic data analysis such as differential weights must be available.
\item Accuracy should be \textless 1kg.
\item Wireless system must work to a range of 5-10 meters.
\item Max expected total load 250kg.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{non-functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system should be able to display the readings to a generic device such as an iphone, android phone or tablet. 
\item There should be a button to initialise readings.
\item System must be portable.
\item System must be compatible with the load cells that would be produced by a different team.
\item Each of the scale control units should be roughly 25cm\textsuperscript{2}.
\item Scale unit meet IP65 requirements (dust sealed, resistant to low powered jets of water from all directions).
\item The scale units should be battery powered, using batteries that are easily accessible from any shop selling batteries.
\item There should be a physical on-off switch at each unit.
\end{itemize}
