This is the documentation for the Electronic and Software Engineering Level 3 Team Project for Team N. Out of the 3 ESE project proposals the team picked the ``Choose your own projec" supervised by Dr. Martin Macauley.

It was suggested by Dr. Macauley that a group within the University may require something built for them and that this would create a real world evironment with a client and system requirements that were externally defined. The UGRacing team had previously given projects to previous teams and were therefore sought out for a source of a project. They requested that a wireless weighing system was built in order to measure the weight of the car that they were building over the course of the year.
