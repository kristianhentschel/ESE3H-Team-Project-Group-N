UGRacing needed a way to measure the weight of each wheel in order to optimize the weight distribution of the car. The team are currently using standard bathroom scales to measure the weight distrobution of the car. Being highly unpractical UGRacing require a solution that is safe, accurate and portable. The creation of a wireless system will allow all readings to be viewed by a generic handheld unit. Using a wireless system will also reduce the number of potential trip hazards in the workshop.
