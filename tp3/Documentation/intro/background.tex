UGR is a group of students competing in a competition called Formula Student. This is a world wide competition run by university groups with 100 entrants from 34 countries (numbers taken from the Formula Student 2012 competition) carried out every year; the goal of each group is to create a single seat race car that competes against the other groups at the Silverstone Grand Prix track in June/July. 

The cars produced are assessed on a number of attributes including: handling, robustness, speed and acceleration.
