The project team has chosen to work with student-led engineering group \emph{UGRacing} within the University and agreed with them the requirements for a wireless multi-point weighing system. An initial design using a Raspberry Pi computer, ZigBee wireless transceivers, the ARM Cortex M4 microprocessor, and an instrumentation amplifier connected to a load cell is proposed and developed. Two different printed circuit boards to interface the components are created. Software for the microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi is developed, creating libraries for communicating with the ZigBee devices over a serial port. A user interface in the form of a web application for access to measurements on any WiFi enabled device is designed and implemented. The basic components of the system are prototyped and evaluated, solving the communications and user interface issues but failing to integrate and test actual measurement equipment due to lack of support from the external equipment suppliers. Suggestions for solutions to issues with the system and further improvement to the prototype are presented.
