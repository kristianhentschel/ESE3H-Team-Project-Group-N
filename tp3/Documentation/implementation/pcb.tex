OrCAD Capture from Cadence in conjunction with PCB Editor from Allegro was used to create the schematic and PCB respectively.  An additional component library was required to allow simulation in OrCAD Capture and placement in PCB Editor. The following components were created by Ian Young - University of Glasgow, for use in the Wireless Weighing System:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Digi International XBee S2 module
		\item $13\times2$ Header for connecting the Raspberry Pi
		\item STM32F4 breakout connectors
	\end{itemize}
