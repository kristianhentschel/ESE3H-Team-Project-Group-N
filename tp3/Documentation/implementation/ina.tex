The client suggested an amplifier for the project at the start, this being the INA129. This is an amplifier requiring little power, that is accurate and requires only $700\mu$ quiescent current \cite{ina} and therefore meets the requirements of the scale units fairly well .

As stated an instrumentation amplifier is required to increase the range of output voltage from the wheatstone bridge to a more manageable level for the microcontroller. Given that a microcontroller with $V_{DD} = 3\unit{V}$, which is also the full scale voltage for the ADC is being used, the best thing to do is amplify the largest possible output from the bridge up to $3\unit{V}$. That way the output should range from $0\unit{V}$ to $3\unit{V}$. 

Given that the maximum voltage on the output of the wheatstone bridge is $0.37V$ this would make the required gain of the INA $\frac{3V}{0.37V}$ which is $8.10V$. So using the equation for gain obtained from the datasheet of the INA: \(Gain(A_{v}) = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}\) and the equation to calibrate the INA for this amplification: 
$A_v = 1 + \frac{2R_a}{R_g}$ therefore in this case $A_v = 1 + \frac{49.4K}{8.1}$

Manipulating this equation you find that $R_g = \frac{2R_a}{A_v - 1}$ plugging in the desired gain of $8.1$ and the value for $R_a$ defined by the data sheet for the INA it can be shown that $R_g$ should be a $7.0\unit{K\Omega}$ resistor.
