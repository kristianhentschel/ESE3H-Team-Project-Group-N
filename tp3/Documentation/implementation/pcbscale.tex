The Scale Unit is controlled by an STM32Fx Discovery series microcontroller, much like for the Central Unit a simple PCB is required to interface the XBee modules to the controller.  Unlike the Central Unit however, protection circuits are not required, instead the Scale Units requires a mobile power supply to allow a completely wireless system.

In order to keep the system as simple as possible it was decided to use a single 5v voltage regulator connected to the STM32Fx Discovery board. The STM32Fx Discovery has a 5v rail which can be used as a 5v supply when connected to USB power, or as an input if the USB cable is not connected. As well as the 5v rail the STM32Fx Discovery board also provides a regulated 3v supply, via either the $V_{DD}$ or 3v pins. This supply will be used for power the XBee modules which have a supply voltage range of 2.8v-3.4v as well as any other circuitry required for the analogue design.
