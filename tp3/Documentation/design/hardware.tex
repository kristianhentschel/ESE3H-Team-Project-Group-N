\subsection{Central Unit}
\label{central_design}
When designing the central unit of course the main considerations are the system requirements (see \ref{sec:system}) in particular the fact that the information must be accessible from a generic device such as a phone or tablet. This being the case it makes sense that this stage of information transport should fit a very common standardised information protocol. Once this was realised the idea of using HTTP became very popular as it was something that the team was familier with, having built a webserver as part of a different course. This approach of using the central unit to host the information via http means that any device capable of connecting to the network and displaying a webpage, will easily be able to manipulate the system and retrieve information. Using a webpage also makes creating the user interface a fairly simple process, that the users will also be familiar with and will require little instruction. 

The central unit can be placed anywhere in the room and therefore does not have strict design constraints  in terms of powering the device, it can be battery powered or simply plugged into a wall socket or computer. Obviously battery power has many issues, such as limited life span, unstable voltage supply and increased cost, therefore USB power was found to be be the most suitable approach. This means that it can be powered by simple AC adaptor and this creates a very reliable 5V supply.

\subsection{Scale Units}
\label{scale_units}
The scale units are the lowest level system, they are essentially load cell control units. This means that they are the responsible for interfacing to the base analogue output of the load cell, converting it into digital form and then transmitting it to the central unit. This will require several components: Chiefly, some form of microcontroller with an anologue to digital converter, a wireless communication device, a circuit that travels through a strain gauge then into a wheatstone bridge and finally into an instrumentation amplifier in order to increase the resolution and expand the small voltage difference to use the full range used by the ADC. 

In terms of wireless communication device, it will require the capability to have one to many communication, relatively low power consumption, a range of at least 5m (preferably more) and cost effectiveness.
