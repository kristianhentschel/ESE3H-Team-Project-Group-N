The proposed solution is to have four simple scale units. These units will receive the analogue signal from a Load Cell, convert it into a digital value and then send that to a central unit via a wireless communication module. The central unit will recieve messages containing the weight from each of the four different scale units. The central unit will be the hub of the system; where all the information is brought together, analysed and provided to the user. This component will need a microcontroller and a wireless communication device capable of communicating with all four of the scale units. It will then need to provide this information to a user in a standardised way in order to make it accessible from a generic device as required.
