The proposed solution is to have 4 simple scale units. These units will simply recieve the analogue signal from a loadcell, convert it into a digital form and then send that to a central unit via a wireless communication module. The central unit will recieve messages containing the weight from each of the 4 different scale units. It will then need to provide this information to a user in a standardised way in order to make it accessible from a generic device as required (see sec\ref{section:system}).%TODO
