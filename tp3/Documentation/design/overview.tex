\subsection{Proposed Design}
Following the project scope we decided to base the system on four `slave' units with a centralised `master' unit. The `master' unit will be used both as a controller for each of the `slave' units as well as acting as a webserver, that will allow any memeber of UGRacing to use their personal smartphone, tablet, or personal computer to both control the system and view the measurements via a universal web application.
