The proposed solution is to have 4 simple scale units. These units will simply recieve the analogue signal from a loadcell, convert it into an integer in digital form and then send that to a central unit via a wireless communication module. The central unit will recieve messages containing the weight from each of the 4 different scale units. It will then need to provide this information to a user in a standardised way in order to make it accessible from a generic device as required (see sec\ref{section:NFR}. See fig \ref{fig:Block Diagram} for a block diagram of the prosed design.

%This approach of using the central unit to host the information on a network means that any device capable of %connecting to the network and displaying a webpage, will easily be able to manipulat the system and retreive %information. This fits the requirement of being accessible from a generic handheld device such as a phone or %tablet found in ref{section:NFR}.
