This is the central hub of the system; where all the information is brought together, analysed and provided to the user of the system. This component will need a microcontroller and a wireless communication device capable of communicating with all four of the scale units. It will then need to provide this information to a user in a standardised way in order to make it accessible from a generic device as required.
