These units are where the majority of the work is done, they are essentially load cell control units. This means that they are the responsible for interfacing to the base analogue output of the load cell, configuring it to a manageable form and then transmitting it to the central unit. This will require several components cheifly some form of microcontroller with an ADC, a wirelss communication device, a circuit that travels through a load cell into a wheatstone bridge and then into instrumentation amplifier in order to increase accuracy.
